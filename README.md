### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm [**Harshal Dhage**](https://github.com/FOSSEE-eSim), a **Digital IC Design and RTL Verification Enthusiast** from **Maharashtra, India**.

I am currently a **Research Intern at [NIELIT Aurangabad](https://www.nielit.gov.in/)**, working on the **design of a 32-bit Superscalar Dual-Issue RISC-V CPU**. My work includes **dual-issue fetch/decode/dispatch units, hazard detection, forwarding logic, branch prediction, and memory hierarchy optimization**.

Previously, I was a **RTL Design Intern at [FOSSEE, IIT Bombay](https://esim.fossee.in/)**, where I **designed synthesizable RTL modules for analog and digital ICs**, performed functional verification, contributed reusable IP blocks to eSim, and maintained documentation in LaTeX and GitHub.

My interests are in **Digital IC Design, RTL Design, and Verification**, with a strong focus on **processor microarchitecture, open-source IP development, and EDA workflows**.  
I enjoy building **scalable, modular, and high-performance hardware architectures** and contributing to research-driven hardware projects.

Outside of engineering, I like exploring **EDA tools**, sharing technical insights, and mentoring beginners in **VLSI and digital design**.
